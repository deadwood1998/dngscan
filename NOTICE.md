## darktable AgX (GPL-3.0-or-later)

The `agx` tone-mapping mode in `dngscan.core` ports portions of the AgX view-transform
implementation from darktable:

- https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/blob/cf5e698c1a5afac52de785c3bf63fcbcb71707d3/src/iop/agx.c
- https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/blob/cf5e698c1a5afac52de785c3bf63fcbcb71707d3/data/kernels/agx.cl

darktable is licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later. Because this project incorporates that
code, the combined work is distributed under **GPL-3.0-or-later** as well.
Reference copies of `agx.c` and `agx.cl` are included under `dngscan_assets/` with
their original GPL notices intact. The exact upstream commit is recorded in
`dngscan_assets/README.md` so changes in darktable `master` cannot silently redefine
dngscan's rendering baseline.

The AgX inset/outset primaries derive from Troy Sobotka's AgX family of view
transforms. Optional Blender-reference geometries follow the published construction
used by Eary Chow's AgX LUT generator:

No third-party display or camera LUT is distributed with dngscan.

## spektrafilm film profiles (CC BY-SA 4.0)

Film stock profiles under `dngscan_assets/spectral/spektrafilm/` (spectral
sensitivities and characteristic curves for Kodak Portra 400 / Portra Endura and
Fujifilm Superia X-TRA 400 / Crystal Archive Type II) come verbatim from Andrea
Volpato's spektrafilm project:

- https://github.com/andreavolpato/agx-emulsion

spektrafilm's code is GPL-3.0-or-later; its profile data is licensed separately
under **CC BY-SA 4.0** (license text included alongside the files). dngscan's film
curve presets and prefeed targets derived from these profiles are treated as direct
derivatives under the same CC BY-SA 4.0 terms, with provenance recorded in
`dngscan_assets/spectral/spektrafilm/README.md` and in each preset's `source` field.
The upstream data was processed from manufacturer datasheets and scientific papers;
original measurements remain the property of their respective manufacturers.

## RAW to ACES spectral data (Apache-2.0)

Selected camera sensitivities and training reflectances under
`dngscan_assets/spectral/` come from the Academy Software Foundation's
`rawtoaces-data` repository:

- https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/rawtoaces-data

That source repository is licensed under Apache-2.0. Derived CSV files retain
source and measurement notes in `dngscan_assets/spectral/README.md`.
