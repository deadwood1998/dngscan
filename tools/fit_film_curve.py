"""Fit AgX curve parameters to a film stock's published characteristic curves.

This is the formation leg of the film-observation contract
(docs/FILM_OBSERVATION_PLAN.zh-CN.md §4): AgX is not replaced — a film preset is a
*named coordinate* in AgX's existing parameter space, solved by least squares against
the end-to-end (negative + paired print) neutral response derived from spektrafilm's
datasheet-processed profiles. Every preset records its source and fit residual; the
runtime only ever consumes the fitted AgX parameters through the same compiled C1
machinery every render already uses.

End-to-end target construction (SPECTRAL contact print; see the section comment at
_load_spectral for provenance and validation):
    D_neg(lambda,e) = sum_dye amount_dye(e) * dyeSpec(lambda) + base(lambda)
    E_paper_c(e)    = integral S_paper_c(lambda) * I_enlarger(lambda) * 10^-D_neg
    dye_paper_c(e)  = paper_curve_c(log10 E_paper_c + k_c)     (printer lights k)
    RGB(e)          = relative colorimetry of the print's dye stack vs its white
                      under the declared viewing illuminant (CIE 1931 -> linear sRGB)
    T(e)            = ((RGB + f)/(1 + f))^s                    (viewing flare f,
                      surround term s; both routed by the medium's viewing condition)
The printer lights k are solved so the print is neutral at mid; the exposure anchor
is then a GLOBAL shift solved so viewed Y = 0.18 (light-meter semantics — the
profiles' logE=0 is a normalization convention, not scene mid-gray), followed by
per-channel micro-gains that pin exact neutrality. Scene EV = logE / log10(2).

Offline tool: writes dngscan/film_curve_presets.json entries and a comparison plot.
No scipy; a compact Nelder-Mead is included.
