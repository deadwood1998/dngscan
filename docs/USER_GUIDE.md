# dngscan User Guide

This is the manual without the math. It answers three questions: which cameras this tool
can handle, what every number on screen means, and what to pick when exporting. For the
pipeline internals and technical detail, see the
[architecture notes](ARCHITECTURE.md).

dngscan does one thing: it turns RAW photos into faithful JPEGs — ordinary JPEGs, or HDR
photos that genuinely light up on capable screens (iPhone / Mac / recent Android photo
apps all display them natively).

## 1. Supported cameras

**The default decoder (LibRaw)** covers the vast majority of RAW formats on the market,
including but not limited to:

| Brand | Formats |
|---|---|
| Canon | CR2 / CR3 |
| Nikon | NEF / NRW |
| Sony | ARW |
| Fujifilm | RAF (including X-Trans sensors) |
| Panasonic / OM System / Leica / Pentax | RW2 / ORF / DNG / PEF and others |
| Sigma, iPhone (ProRAW), and anything that writes DNG | DNG |

It works out of the box — no per-camera plugins. Development and calibration happened
primarily on Sigma fp DNGs and iPhone ProRAW, so those are the most thoroughly
validated; other mainstream cameras decode and convert normally, and sample files for
anything misbehaving are welcome.

**Brand-new bodies work too**: cameras so recent that built-in data tables haven't
caught up (the A7 V / GR IV / X-E5 generation) are not refused — the tool degrades
gracefully and the report states plainly that calibration data is incomplete and
results may deviate, while the photo exports normally. Several new bodies
(A7 V / A7S III / A7R VI / GR IV / Nikon Zf / X100VI / X-E5) already ship with
measured sensor data and colour matrices, matching the established-camera experience.

**The Apple RAW decoder (optional — set "解码器 / Decoder" to Apple RAW)** uses the RAW
engine built into macOS. Its coverage follows Apple's official camera RAW compatibility
list — mainstream Canon, Nikon, Sony, Fujifilm, Panasonic and Sigma bodies plus iPhone
are on it, but **the newest decode model (RAW 9) is only open to the more recent bodies
among them**. You never need to look this up yourself: after you pick a file the tool
probes what that exact file supports, and if RAW 9 is unavailable it tells you plainly
and lets you choose an older version or fall back to LibRaw — it never switches
algorithms silently.

The two decoders have slightly different color personalities (Apple's denoising and
highlight reconstruction feel more "camera-manufacturer"); both produce SDR and HDR
normally. When in doubt, use the default LibRaw.

## 2. Basic workflow

1. **Pick a file** — the RAW file selector at the top;
2. **Read the Detected Parameters card** — the tool has already analyzed the photo;
   look here before touching anything (next section explains each number);
3. **Adjust exposure and tone** — if needed;
4. **Choose the output** — ordinary JPEG or HDR, for sharing or for archiving
   (section 5);
5. **Update the preview to confirm, then export.**

---

## 3. What the Detected Parameters mean

This card shows the tool's measurements of your photo — the same analysis the final
render will use.

**First, EV**: EV means "stops", photography's exposure unit. +1 EV = twice as bright,
−1 EV = half. Every EV in this tool is anchored at **middle gray** (the 18% gray of a
correct exposure — roughly the midtone brightness of a properly exposed face): +3 EV is
three stops brighter than middle gray, −5 EV five stops darker.

| Field | Meaning | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **RAW clipping** | Share of sensor pixels that blew out ("dead white") | High values mean burned highlights; the colors there are guesses, and the tool automatically trusts them less |
| **Reliable highlight tail** | The brightest content that was **genuinely measured without clipping** (clipped pixels excluded — they don't count) | This is the sole budget for HDR brightness: if a neon sign measured +6 EV, HDR can honestly light it to +6 |
| **Earned HDR headroom** | The part of the reliable tail above "paper white" (a normal white on screen) | Exactly how many stops brighter than an ordinary photo this HDR can go; 0 means there is nothing worth HDR in this shot |
| **Subject median** | Roughly which stop the scene's body sits at | Strongly negative = a dark scene (night); near 0 = standard exposure |
| **Scene type** | Normal / sparse emitters | "Sparse emitters" = mostly-dark frames with small very-bright sources (night lights, stages); the tool automatically switches to a highlight policy suited to them |
| **Compiled curve** | The dark-to-bright range and contrast this render actually adopted | Reference values, so you know what the tool decided for this image |

**A typical read of this card**: earned headroom +1.5 EV → worth exporting HDR; RAW
clipping 8% → the sky may be burned, try the "reconstruct" highlight mode; subject
median −3 EV → this is a night scene, don't force the exposure up.

## 3.5 White balance: As Shot vs fixed Kelvin

Besides "As Shot", the white balance selector offers a set of **fixed color
temperatures**. These are not for balancing by eye — eyeballing neutrality on a screen
never beats the camera's metering (your eyes chromatically adapt while you look). They
are **declared standard references**: the values come from industry calibrations, and
the multipliers are solved precisely from the photo file's own color calibration, with
no eye in the loop.

| Option | What it is | When |
|---|---|---|
| **As Shot** | The balance the camera metered at capture | Default; everyday output |
| **6500K · D65** | The standard white point of sRGB/Rec.709 displays | Aligning with display-industry standards |
| **5500K · photographic daylight** | The calibration temperature of daylight-balanced film | **The correct starting point for film simulation**: one fixed 5500K for the whole roll, letting the actual light's warmth or coolness pass through — tungsten light *should* look orange, exactly as real film behaves |
| **3400K · Type A** | Type A tungsten film (photoflood lamps) | Tungsten film simulation |
| **3200K · Type B** | Type B tungsten film (3200K studio tungsten/halogen) | Same, the more common tungsten calibration |
| **9300K · Japanese broadcast white** | The traditional white point of Japanese television (cool blue) | The "old Japanese TV" cool look — for fun |

Fixed Kelvin works on both decoders. A visible color cast after choosing one is
**expected behavior** — it is precisely how film sees the world, not a malfunction.

## 3.7 Film observation positions (20 stocks + 5 theatrical variants)

Up front: **this is not a one-tap filter**. It decomposes "how a roll of film saw
the world" into independent, declared layers. The payoff is that every layer can
be understood and adjusted on its own; the price is two minutes to build the
mental model. These paragraphs are those two minutes.

### The mental model: film decides what was seen; AgX decides how to develop it

Picking a stock sets five controls at once (**all visible, all adjustable —
nothing is baked**):

| Layer | What it does | When to touch it |
|---|---|---|
| **White balance** (RAW decode card) | Locks the stock's calibration temperature: 5500K daylight, 3200K tungsten cine | Orange tungsten scenes are **by design** (real film behaves this way); switch back to As Shot if you don't want it |
| **Spectral prefeed** (prefeed card) | How this stock's layers **separate** colour (its skin/foliage character), from datasheets | Usually leave it; set to none to drop the stock's colour separation entirely |
| **Separation strength** (slider) | Intensity of that separation. The combo sets a per-stock suggestion (Velvia ×1.6) | **Too mild → push up; too strong → pull down.** 1.0 = calibration strength; the suggestion is editorial taste, not measurement |
| **Development curve** (tone card) | The stock + paired medium's tone signature: black floor, latitude, highlight rolloff. Fixed per roll, no scene adaptation | Usually leave it; the tone trims still stack on top |
| **AgX primaries** (imaging card) | The density/saturation "punch": base/punchy/muted. Paired per stock (Velvia→punchy, Kodachrome→muted) | **The bigger style lever** — switch here for more bite or more restraint |

How colour finally *develops* onto your screen (path-to-white, hue behaviour)
always belongs to AgX — the most thoroughly validated part of the pipeline, and
the reason this film simulation stays stable.

### Three steps to start

1. Pick a stock and export — the combo already carries its suggested style;
2. Adjust to taste: **too mild** → raise separation strength or switch primaries
   to punchy; **too strong** → the reverse; **dislike the colour-temperature
   cast** → set WB back to As Shot (keeping only the separation and curve);
3. Want the no-film baseline? Set film to none — pure AgX.

### Common intents

- Rich landscape chrome → Velvia 100 (ships punchy + ×1.6)
- Soft portraits → Portra 400 (switch to muted for softer still)
- Restrained vintage → Kodachrome 64
- The raw high-contrast "2383 print on a monitor" look → the **theatrical** variants
- Flat wide-latitude cine scans → the Vision3 family
- Film tone only, no colour separation → prefeed none, keep the curve preset

### Boundaries worth knowing

- Slides and cinema prints target **dark projection rooms** (~1.5× contrastier);
  delivery to an everyday screen translates that away using the classic
  viewing-condition constants (including standard reflection-print viewing flare)
  — *looking* right on your display outranks being numerically raw;
- **Two modes** (CLI `--film-mode`): the default **observe** is everything above —
  use it day to day. **full** is experimental: the film development model takes
  over per-channel colour entirely (stronger character, but the colour
  reconstruction has no measured ground truth and can drift unnaturally); SDR
  only;
- No grain, no vignette — it changes *how the camera saw the world*;
- **HDR keeps working** (observe mode): a film body plus genuinely measured
  highlight headroom — a combination no other film tool offers.

**Lens filters** (RAW decode card) are the companion control: Wratten conversion
glass simulated from Kodak's published parameters (85B daylight-to-tungsten, 80A the
reverse, and others), for recreating historical workflows like "tungsten film + 85B in
daylight". There is no strength slider — glass has no half-installed state.

## 4. The other EVs in the interface

- **Exposure EV** (the slider): brightens/darkens everything, +1 = one stop up. 0 keeps
  the brightness relationships from capture.
- **Brightness reference** (button): the tool measures the subject and aligns it to a
  standard exposure while limiting highlight overflow. "Expose this for me, once" — the
  result is written back to the slider and can be adjusted further.
- **HDR headroom ceiling** (output card): how many stops above paper white your screen
  or use case allows at most. It is a **ceiling, not a target** — actual usage is
  decided by the earned headroom, whichever is smaller. The default +3.0 (roughly an
  800-nit screen) rarely needs changing.

---

## 5. The compression cores, and which to pick

RAW records a far wider brightness range than any screen can show; the "compression
core" is how the former is fitted into the latter. It decides the overall look —
especially how highlights behave in color.

| Option | One line | When |
|---|---|---|
| **AgX · default** | Film-style highlight handling: bright areas fade naturally toward white instead of staying garishly saturated | **Use this when unsure** — 95% of the time |
| **RAW-gated · fidelity** | Same brightness as AgX, but the color processing strength is decided per pixel by RAW evidence: colors the sensor genuinely measured are preserved harder | When you want colors more "faithful to the sensor"; LibRaw decoding only |
| **Scene C1 · luminance only** | Compresses brightness only, never touches color ratios | A control group: switch here to see what AgX's color handling is actually doing |
| **Fixed curve · diagnostic** | A fixed curve that ignores the scene | For troubleshooting, not for daily use |

The last two are comparison/diagnostic tools, not finishing tools.

## 6. Output: formats and delivery profiles

**Formats**:
- **SDR JPEG** — an ordinary photo, viewable everywhere;
- **HDR gain-map · JPEG** — the recommended HDR format. The file carries both a normal
  rendition and the highlight-boost information; on capable screens (iPhone, Mac,
  Android 15+) highlights genuinely light up, everywhere else it gracefully shows the
  normal version — nothing breaks;
- **HDR gain-map · HEIC** — the same content in a HEIC container. **Measured on this
  machine it is neither smaller nor better** — choose it only when a downstream
  requires HEIC.

**Delivery profiles**:
- **Archive · fidelity** — maximum quality (~60 MB per frame), for high-quality
  keeping;
- **Share · streaming** — for publishing (~11–27 MB per frame): visually
  near-identical, HDR information fully preserved, and **even the largest frames stay
  inside WeChat's 25 MB original-image limit**.

**WeChat notes**: in chats you must tick **原图 (original image)** for HDR to survive
to the recipient (iPhone WeChat shows full HDR when viewing the original); **Moments
always recompresses to an ordinary photo** — that is WeChat's behavior and no tool can
bypass it. For deliveries that matter, sending as a "file" is the safest path.

**After exporting, read the Delivery Report** — the collapsible panel above the
preview. It states what actually happened: file size, how many stops of HDR were really
used, how small the compression error measured. Every exported file passed an automatic
verification; files that fail it are never kept.

## 7. FAQ

**HDR export fails with "the reliable highlight tail supports no HDR headroom"?**
The photo has no genuinely measured highlight content (its earned headroom is 0). This
is not a malfunction — an HDR of a photo with no bright content would look identical
anyway. Export SDR instead.

**Chose Apple RAW and got told the file only supports RAW 8?**
Your camera/file is outside RAW 9's coverage. Continue with the older version as
prompted, or switch back to LibRaw; both produce normal output.

**Will the preview differ from the export?**
The preview uses a low-resolution proxy for speed; framing and tone match. Judge
sharpness and noise from the full-size export. Numbers labeled "full-resolution truth"
in the export status are the final ones.

**Where can I see the HDR effect?**
Open the exported file in macOS Preview/Finder, iPhone Photos, an Android 15+ gallery,
or Chrome. On ordinary monitors or older systems it is simply a normal JPEG.

**Why are quality and chroma subsampling sometimes locked?**
The archive profile pins maximum quality by definition; in HDR formats the chroma
subsampling is decided by the system encoder from the quality setting — the tool shows
the truth rather than pretending it is adjustable.
