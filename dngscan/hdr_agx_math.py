"""HDR AgX v2 tone math: a log-stop shoulder that cannot reach into the toe.

v1 bought its extended white by raising the whole curve's encoding gamma. That works
arithmetically -- the encoded shoulder does reach 2^H -- but gamma is a coordinate of the
*entire* curve, so raising it to 4.7 also rewrote the toe. Measured on real frames, mid
gray and its local derivative held while -4 EV fell about 1.5 EV and the deepest shadows
lost nearly three stops. Headroom was silently buying darkness.

v2 puts the degree of freedom where the change belongs. Below the shoulder start K the
curve is the darktable body at its own fixed gamma, and nothing in this module can touch
it. Above K a cubic Hermite runs in output-stop coordinates

    z(e) = log2(T(e) / 0.18)

from (K, Z_K) with the body's own slope M_K to (W, Z_peak) with slope exactly zero. The
structural consequence is the property v1 could not offer: changing H changes only the
segment above K, so `T(e)` for `e <= K` is bit-identical across headrooms.

Output stops are the right coordinate because a one-stop scene change is a doubling in
linear T. Demanding a "decelerating" curve in linear T mistakes ordinary exposure
proportionality for runaway growth; in z it is just slope 1, and a shoulder is honestly a
reduction of dz/de toward zero.

Monotonicity is decided by a stated condition rather than inspection: with the white
tangent pinned at zero, a single cubic Hermite is monotone exactly when the normalized
start tangent alpha lies in [0, 3]. Alpha above 3 does not mean the request is malformed:
display headroom caps Z_peak independently of the tail-driven W, so a low-headroom
display with a long reliable tail legitimately asks for a shoulder more compressive than
one cubic can carry. There the compiler subdivides into a monotone Hermite chain that
keeps the same structural contract -- the K tangent, the zero white tangent and C1 joins
between pieces -- so behaviour stays continuous in the headroom control instead of
snapping to "no HDR". Fail-closed remains for genuinely degenerate input (empty window,
non-positive rise, non-finite anchors). Subdivision stays an explicit opt-in argument so
auxiliary callers state which contract they want.

Float64 and image-free: this is the oracle the float32 runtime is checked against.
