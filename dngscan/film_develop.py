"""Film-takeover development core (film_mode="full") — EXPERIMENTAL.

The two-mode contract (docs/FILM_OBSERVATION_PLAN): in "observe" mode the film
declares what the observer saw (WB, separation, tone signature) and AgX develops
it — colour rendering stays with the pipeline's own validated preferred rendering.
This module is the other pole: the film's development model takes over and AgX
yields everything but delivery-side gamut safety.

What "the film's development model" means with today's data: the fitted scalar
curve applied PER CHANNEL at each channel's own exposure, times the measured
per-channel ratio field r_c(EV_c)/r_c(EV_Y) — i.e. the medium's per-channel
transfer as reconstructed by the spectral print fitter. No AgX inset/outset, no
hue restore, no punch: colour behaviour comes (only) from the film data.

Honesty label: the tone dimension of that data is externally validated (DiVERE
cross-check); the COLOUR dimension is an unanchored reconstruction with no
external oracle yet — which is why this core is opt-in and marked experimental,
and why "observe" is the default. SDR only for now: the HDR formation's colour
machinery is AgX-owned and has no film-takeover counterpart.
