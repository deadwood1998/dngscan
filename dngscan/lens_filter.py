"""Declared lens conversion filters: glass in front of the lens, as published constants.

A Wratten conversion filter is specified by Kodak in exactly two published numbers: its
mired shift and its filter factor. The mired shift is the definition of the filter's
colour action (85B: +131 mired warms 5500K light to tungsten's 3200K; 80A: -131 does the
reverse), so deriving the scene-linear matrix from it is working from the specification,
not from taste. The matrix is a Bradford-adapted von Kries transport between the two
white points, expressed in linear Rec.2020.

The filter's purpose — the first semantics — is to move the *illuminant* onto the
film's calibration point: daylight stock under tungsten light plus an 80A sees light ×
filter ~= its design illuminant, and in the film's own frame the neutral axis does not
move at all. Used as intended, the filter pairs with a mismatched declared WB (WB
3200K + 85B in daylight; WB 5500K + 80A under tungsten), the two cancel to near
neutral, and every downstream calibration window remains valid. Applying the filter
alone on a matched balance — the deliberate colour cast — is the *declared degenerate
case*: real film driven that way runs deep into excitation regions our separation fits
never covered, so the prefeed's chromaticity windows fading toward identity there is a
refusal to extrapolate, not a malfunction.

Deliberate simplifications, stated rather than hidden:
- Spectral transmission refinement (integrating a digitized T(lambda) against camera
  SSFs) would capture the small material-dependent residual beyond the mired action;
  pending machine-readable curves, the published-constant derivation is the honest core.
- The published filter factor (light absorbed by the glass) is recorded as metadata but
  normalized out of the matrix: digital application has no reason to discard photons,
  and Kodak's exposure guidance already assumes the photographer compensates.

There is no strength control. A filter has no half-installed state.

Position in the pipeline: scene-linear Rec.2020, after decode/WB, before the prefeed —
the same order as the physical light path (filter before the film's spectral response).
This module stays separate from scene_transform because the two hold different
invariants: the prefeed keeps the working frame's neutral axis fixed, while the filter
re-expresses the light itself — moving the rendered neutral axis whenever its partner
illuminant mismatch is absent.

    axis. Note the semantics: the shift acts on the *rendered* balance — a neutral in

    which is exactly how a filter behaves on already-balanced film. Numbers like
