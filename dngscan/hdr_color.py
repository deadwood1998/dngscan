"""HDR colour geometry around the native extended-white AgX formation.

The HDR curve is the sole brightness authority. Colour is chosen between two formations
of the same inset RGB: a reference-white AgX response supplies the conservative common
chroma path, while the extended-white AgX response supplies the native per-channel path.
Both candidates are aligned to the extended response's luminance before `rho` mixes them:

    common = reference * Y_native / Y_reference
    result = normalize_Y((1-rho)*common + rho*native, Y_native)

No smootherstep or second tone gain remains. `rho` changes only chromaticity, CFA masks
can withdraw per-channel freedom, and the native HDR curve always owns luminance.

The gamut fit is a separate function from the SDR one on purpose. The SDR fitter targets
[0,1]; an HDR rendition legitimately lives in [0, R_display], and reusing the SDR fitter
would clip away exactly the range this whole phase exists to produce.
