"""Core Image RAW 9 scene-linear Rec.2020 decoder.

A separate pipeline rather than a LibRaw back end: Core Image executes the file's DNG
opcodes, so its frame is a warp of LibRaw's and per-pixel CFA evidence cannot be carried
across (raw_io drops the masks; see the comment there). Aggregate RAW facts — levels,
clip percentages, SNR, noise floor, white-balance testimony — are distributions rather
than pixel positions and still come from LibRaw.

The decode follows Apple's recipe for reaching linear scene-referred data (WWDC21
"Capture and process ProRAW images"): baselineExposure, shadowBias, boostAmount,
localToneMapAmount and the RAW exposure control at 0, EDR and gamut mapping off, rendered
into extendedLinearITUR_2020. Adjustable look controls are neutralised where RAW 9 exposes
a meaningful neutral value; moire is deliberately left at Apple's default because its zero
is the strongest smoothing end. Highlight recovery and lens correction are enabled
explicitly because they belong to Apple's camera interpretation, not to dngscan's
downstream display transform.

The file-authored baselineExposure is recorded before it is cleared. ``raw_io`` restores
that scalar exactly once through ``scene_scale`` after the decoder handoff, matching the
LibRaw path without baking rendering intent into the decoder pixels. This keeps the handoff
strictly scene-linear while preserving the file's intended relative exposure downstream.

The handoff is signed float16. Extended-linear Rec.2020 legitimately contains negative
components and values above 1.0; quantising it through an unsigned sensor-white buffer
would destroy both before AgX sees them.

Importing this module must not raise when Quartz/PyObjC is absent.
