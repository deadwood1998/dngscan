"""Fixed-Kelvin white balance: declared references, never eyeballed neutrality.

The mode list is deliberately a set of named standards rather than a slider. Adaptive
"find neutral by eye" loses to the camera's own metering every time (the eye chromatically
adapts while you look); a declared reference has no eye in the loop — its accuracy is a
property of the camera's colour calibration, not of anyone's judgement.

LibRaw path: the target CCT becomes camera-RGB multipliers through the DNG relation
``CameraNeutral = ColorMatrix @ XYZ(white)``. LibRaw exposes one ColorMatrix (Adobe's
D65-referenced table), so this is the single-matrix solve; DNG dual-illuminant
interpolation (ColorMatrix1/2 between CalibrationIlluminant1/2) is a documented future
refinement, not silently faked. Daylight-family targets (>= 4000 K) sit on the CIE
daylight locus with the revised-c2 temperature correction; tungsten targets are true
blackbodies on the Planckian locus (Kim et al. approximation), because Type A/B film is
balanced for incandescent sources, not for D-series daylight.

RAW 9 path: CIRAWFilter speaks Kelvin natively (``neutralTemperature``/``neutralTint``),
so the declaration is handed to Apple's own calibration unchanged. The two decoders may
therefore realise the same declared reference with slightly different colour — each uses
its own calibration, which is the point, not a defect.
