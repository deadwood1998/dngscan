"""Histogram payloads for the realtime preview.

Two histograms, two declared data contracts, each attached to the control it
informs (the project's data-next-to-function rule):

* **Scene EV** (exposure card): the same reliable-sample selection the tone
  planner compiles its percentiles from (:func:`dngscan.tone.
  reliable_scene_ev_selection`), measured on the fixed 1920px proxy and viewed
  through intent exposure. Moving the EV slider moves this population against
  the plan's fixed compiled endpoints, so the user can watch the body cross the
  black/white points the render actually uses.
* **Display code values** (preview card): the exact rendered 1920px u8 frame
  the browser is about to show, before any auto-EV annotation overlay.

Both are 128-bin integer count arrays; the log vertical scale is a display
choice made by the page, so counts stay raw and JSON-safe here.

Exposure-shift identity (why the per-frame cost is one shift + one bincount):
intent gain is exactly ``g0 * 2**user_ev`` with ``g0 = compute_exposure_gain
(mode, 0.0)`` (see scene_scale.scene_scale_contract_from_bundle), so every
sample's EV at slider position ``e`` equals its EV at 0 plus ``e``. The EV0
selection is therefore computed once per proxy/transform combination and only
shifted per frame. The one divergence from a full recompute is the
EV_REPORT_FLOOR clamp: samples pinned to the floor at EV0 stay excluded at
every slider position instead of un-pinning under large positive EV. Those
samples sit below -11.5 EV at EV0, i.e. below -8.5 EV even at +3, under the
noise floor and largely outside the drawn -10..+4 axis — a declared
approximation, not silent error.
