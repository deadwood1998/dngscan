# dngscan

An open-source imaging workbench for making and studying SDR and HDR images from sensor data.

dngscan began with one practical question: how can I develop a RAW with AgX without opening a full
editor? Once that worked, the more interesting questions surfaced. How much highlight signal did
the sensor actually preserve? Which pixels came from reconstruction? How should one scene become
both SDR and HDR? Can film white balance, spectral response, and formation curves be studied
separately instead of baked into one filter?

dngscan gives those questions a measurable pipeline. It keeps sensor data from before demosaic,
forms a scene-linear Rec.2020 image with LibRaw or Core Image, combines measurements with explicit
image-making choices, then writes color-managed SDR or HDR and checks what was actually delivered.

It already works as a local RAW processor, but its broader value is as an imaging workbench.
Decoding, sensor analysis, display transforms, film observation, and delivery have explicit
boundaries. New decoders, tone cores, film models, and delivery formats can be compared against the
same RAW evidence and validation instead of rebuilding the whole pipeline.

## HDR in one frame

![SDR, exposure-normalized HDR, and HDR curve-expansion map](docs/assets/hdr-comparisons/_SDI0150_native_hdr_ab.jpg)

From left to right: ordinary SDR, an independently formed HDR rendition, and a map of the HDR
luminance expansion. In the map, black means no expansion; white means the full headroom supported
by the evidence in this RAW.

The additional brightness stays around lamps and reflections instead of lifting the entire frame.
HDR-capable devices display those highlights; an ordinary screen still receives a normal SDR JPEG.
If the RAW contains no reliable highlight information, dngscan does not invent HDR headroom.

## Film observation in one frame

![AgX baseline, Portra 400, Velvia 100, and Vision3 250D theatrical compared](docs/assets/film-observation-showcase.jpg)

One RAW, four observation positions: the AgX baseline (no film), Kodak Portra 400
(negative + paper), Fujifilm Velvia 100 (reversal), and Vision3 250D in its theatrical
quotation. Every preset is constructed declaratively from datasheet data — the WB
Kelvin, the layer separation, the development curve, the layer-saturation differential
— with no hand-tuned sliders and no baked LUT. All twenty stocks and five theatrical
variants are described in the [architecture notes](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Features

- **Read the capture:** before demosaic, dngscan measures black and white levels, per-channel
  clipping, CFA geometry, noise, usable dynamic range, and reliable highlight headroom.
- **Choose the scene decoder:** LibRaw and Core Image / RAW 9 are independent choices, but both hand
  the rest of the system a scene-linear Rec.2020 image.
- **Experiment with image formation:** AgX is the default, alongside RAW-gated, luminance-only, and
  diagnostic tone cores. Exposure, white balance, highlight handling, scene transforms, lens
  filters, and film observation remain explicit choices.
- **Form SDR and HDR separately:** SDR targets sRGB or Display P3. HDR starts again from the same
  scene image and uses only the extra brightness supported by un-clipped RAW highlights.
- **Observe and reproduce:** the local GUI and CLI share the same controls; a diagnostic dashboard
  and CSV reports make measurements inspectable and comparisons repeatable. RAW files are never
  uploaded.
- **Deliver, then verify:** archive/share profiles control encoding without changing image
  formation. On macOS, HDR becomes an ISO 21496-1 gain-map JPEG or HEIC and is read back to verify
  the color profile, gain map, declared headroom, and pixel error.

## Quick start

Python 3.10 or newer is required. The validated rawpy/LibRaw dependency is built
from its pinned source revision on first install, so Git and a native compiler
are also required (Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS, or the standard build
toolchain on Linux).

### GUI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gen-416/dngscan.git
cd dngscan
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m dngscan.gui
```

Open the localhost address printed in the terminal. A practical starting point is EV 0 with `AgX`,
`base` primaries, camera WB, and highlight reconstruction; adjust from there according to the
photograph.

The RAW field uses the browser's native file picker. The selected file is sent only to the localhost
dngscan service on the same computer and kept in a process-scoped temporary directory; the temporary
copy is removed when dngscan exits and is never sent to an external service.

### CLI

```bash
# Default AgX JPEG
python -m dngscan photo.dng --jpeg photo.jpg

# Highlight reconstruction and Display P3
python -m dngscan photo.dng --jpeg photo_p3.jpg \
  --highlight-mode reconstruct --output-gamut p3

# HDR gain-map JPEG (macOS, Display P3, AgX only)
python -m dngscan photo.dng --jpeg photo_hdr.jpg \
  --output-format ultrahdr --hdr-headroom 3

# RAW analysis dashboard and CSV
python -m dngscan photo.dng --jpeg photo.jpg --scan --csv photo.csv

# Compare the experimental RAW-gated tone core
python -m dngscan photo.dng --jpeg photo_gated.jpg --tone-core gated

# Use a film observation position
python -m dngscan photo.dng --jpeg photo_portra.jpg --film portra400
```

Run `python -m dngscan --help` for the complete option list.

### Optional C++ acceleration

NumPy is the reference implementation and works without a native extension. The optional pybind11
C++ kernel accelerates only the AgX hot paths; RAW analysis, render planning, and fallback policy
remain in Python.

```bash
pip install pybind11 cmake
tools/build_native.sh
```

## How it works

dngscan keeps measured sensor facts separate from viewing intent until they need to meet in the
render plan.

1. **Read the sensor data.** Before demosaic, dngscan records CFA clipping, per-channel full well,
   noise, and spatial position. Later stages can still distinguish measured highlights from pixels
   created by highlight reconstruction.
2. **Form the scene image.** LibRaw or Core Image decodes the RAW into scene-linear Rec.2020. The
   decoder determines how pixels are formed, not how their brightness and color are subsequently
   compressed.
3. **Bring measurement and intent together.** Analysis separates the scene body, reliable
   highlights, and clipped areas. Those measurements meet the chosen exposure, white balance, look,
   and output gamut in one render plan.
4. **Form SDR.** AgX is the default display transform; alternate tone cores provide controlled
   experiments and diagnostics. The result is an sRGB or Display P3 base image.
5. **Form HDR independently.** This branch starts from the same scene image instead of brightening
   the finished SDR, and uses only the highlight headroom supported by the RAW.
6. **Encode and check the result.** SDR becomes a regular JPEG. HDR packages the SDR and HDR images
   with an ISO 21496-1 gain map, then opens the file again to verify delivery.

## How dngscan differs

The main difference is not the number of controls. It is when the RAW evidence is discarded.

darktable's AgX module, like many display transforms, receives a decoded floating-point image.
dngscan carries pre-demosaic CFA evidence into the final display transform, so the curve still knows
which highlights are trustworthy and color processing can avoid regions that have clipped or been
reconstructed.

dngscan also keeps measurement separate from taste. Black and white levels, clipping, noise, dynamic
range, and the highlight tail belong to analysis. Exposure compensation, white balance, looks, and
LUTs remain explicit user choices. Automatic decisions describe the photograph; they do not choose
its appearance.

HDR is not a stronger version of SDR. The two renditions are formed independently from the same
scene-linear image and share only capture evidence and viewing intent. dngscan also does not treat
“the encoder returned no error” as proof of delivery: it reads the result back and verifies that the
SDR, HDR, and gain map are present as intended.

Those boundaries also leave room to grow. A new decoder can target the common scene contract; a new
tone core or film model can consume the same analysis; a new delivery format can encode finished
images without quietly changing their formation. Each extension remains comparable because the
measurements and validation stay visible.

dngscan does not currently manage a library or perform local retouching. That is a boundary of the
current product, not the full ambition of the project. Its larger potential is an open,
explainable imaging workbench: useful both for making photographs and for comparing algorithms,
testing standards, and developing new image-formation methods on the same captures.
